### ðŸ“š Learning & Acknowledgments

This project is a direct result of the incredible learning resources provided by **jsmastery.pro** and **Adrian Hajdin ([@adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin))**.

Completed as part of an online course to deepen my understanding of GSAP. Key concepts learned include:

- Imperative vs. Declarative Animation: Integrating imperative GSAP animations with React's declarative nature using the useGSAP hook.

- Pinning and Scrubbing: Creating scroll-based animations where element movement is directly tied to the scroll position.

- Advanced Text Effects: Using GSAP's SplitText to create complex character and word-level animations.
